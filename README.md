Step 2: Create a New Project
Go to File → New → Java Project.
Enter project name: UniversityExamsGrading.
Click Finish.

Step 3: Create Packages
Right-click on src → New → Package.
Create these packages:
com.kce.university.model
com.kce.university.service
com.kce.university.exception
com.kce.university.main

Step 4: Add Classes
In each package, create the corresponding .java files.
Copy-paste the full code from the repository into these files.

Step 5: Run Main Class
Go to com.kce.university.main → UniversityMain.java.
Right-click → Run As → Java Application.
